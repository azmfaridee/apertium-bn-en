Bengali and English

                            apertium-bn-en
===============================================================================

This is an Apertium language pair for translating between Bengali and 
English. What you can use this language package for:

* Translating between Bengali and English (under development)
* Morphological analysis of Bengali and English
* Part-of-speech tagging of Bengali and English (under development)

For information on the latter two points, see subheading "For more 
information" below

Requirements
===============================================================================

You will need the following software installed:

* lttoolbox (>= 3.1.2)
* apertium (>= 3.1.1)

If this does not make any sense, we recommend you look at: www.apertium.org

Compiling
===============================================================================

Given the requirements being installed, you should be able to just run:

$ ./configure 
$ make
# make install

You can use ./autogen.sh instead of ./configure you're compiling from
SVN. If you're using a --prefix to ./configure, make sure it's the
same one you used to install apertium itself.
